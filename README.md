# What is this repo?
This repo contains a whole bunch of scripts I've written to help me generate Anki flashcards. At the moment they're only for German vocab, but maybe other topics will come along as we go.

# Why?
Because I'm a lazy computer science student who decided code was easier than manually typing out all the flashcards I needed for my German diploma.

# How do I add the flashcards to Anki?
Each of the scripts outputs `csv` files of cards based on the decks I use in my vocab revision. The way I put the cards into Anki is by just going to the import tool in Anki, selecting the card type I want, and the deck I want, and making sure it's expecting comma separators. Depending on the deck, I'll do different things in regards to how to handle duplicate files. Then I let it do its thing!
